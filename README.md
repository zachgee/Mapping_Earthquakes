# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic site to visualize data pertaining to earthquakes around the globe. To make our site, we used JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data. Our final shows earquakes around the world, with the magnitude of the earthquakes being displayed by the size and color of the cirles that repesent them. In addition, users can toggle between "Street", "Satellite" and "Dark" layers to change their viewing experience.

Visitors to the site ca also togle with the cirles to keep only "major" earthquakes, or can remove the technoic plates if they do not care for them.
